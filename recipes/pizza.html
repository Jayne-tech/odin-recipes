        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>For the dough:</p>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <p>For the toppings:</p>
            <li>2 pizza sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozarella cheese</li>
            <li>Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, vegetables, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475&deg;F.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half for two pizzas. Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozarella cheese over the sauce, and add your desired toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, slice, and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
        </ol>
